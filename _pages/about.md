👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, studying Electronics and Computer Engineering.

🔬 My research interest is in integrating signal processing to solve biomedical problems!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Bachelor's Thesis in the field of Biomedical Radar Sensing at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

# Bachelor Thesis 
## Project Overview:
This project analyzes respiratory patterns in normal and COPD patients using radar signal processing to detect differences under conditions like resting, walking, running, and climbing stairs.

## Objective:
The goal is to derive respiratory rates, evaluate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and create a framework for early detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases.

## Data Processing Approach:
Radar data is preprocessed using Python with bandpass and Savitzky-Golay filters for noise reduction. Key metrics, such as respiratory rate, are extracted using peak detection within a realistic range of 12-18 BPM.

## Hardware and Software Used:

Hardware: IWR1843 radar kit, DCA1000EVM, Empatica E4.

Software: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) on Google Colab.
          Custom-made Python packages that ensure efficient processing of large binary files containing doppler values (Repo link will be later added!)

## Key Findings:
[Preliminary results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toastedjames/biomed/master/_publications/November_Internship_Report.pdf) reveal distinct respiratory patterns for COPD patients compared to normal subjects. Heatmaps and range profiles validate these insights.

## Challenges and Continuing Work:
Managing large binary datasets and optimizing real-time signal processing remain challenging. Work is ongoing to improve SNR calculations and refine respiratory rate accuracy.
